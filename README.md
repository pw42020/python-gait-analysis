## Python Gait Analysis Module
By Liam Beguhn, Rosaha Cho, Alexander Tollman, Patrick Walsh

Initial Python scripted module for analyzing gait from a large dataset from [Nature paper on Database of lower limb kinematics and electromyography during gait-related activities in able-bodied subjects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02341-6#Sec13).

The dataset is available [here](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/01d30db7-95a8-4c39-afb9-4eb1a2f27539).

Once code is created, more will be added to the README.
